##Welcome, Welcome##
Hey all! Welcome to the CodeNewbie Real Python Study Group. I'm Phillip, a fellow CodeNewbie learning Python (read: definitely not an expert!), and I'll do my best to help facilitate the group every week.

##The Setup##
We meet every week to go through a section of the Real Python course, starting with Part I. We'll use a flipped classroom model: go through the sections on your own and do the exercises, and we'll meet and work on the larger assignments together. For the demo portion of the group, let's go round robin style: pick some code that you worked on during the week and walk the group through it.

We'll push code to github repos for comments, suggestions, help, or a delightful code-centered conversation (using github issues!) outside the meeting. This HQ repo is also a great place for more general conversations.

##Basic Study Plan##
Meet Tuesdays 20:00-22:00 EDT

<= 30 min:	demo of previous week's material/code snippets
<= 10 min:	questions
<= 5 min:	discussion of project of the day
remaining:	work!
<= 5 min:	review/feedback

##Rules (tl;dr don't be a jerk)##
