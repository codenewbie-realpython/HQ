WARNING: Python 3 ahead...(that is what Python for Kids book teaches)


Hi all - this was some fun bit of code from the Python for Kids book I am working my way through. 

Suppose you are digging in your backyard and uncover a bag of 20 gold coins. The next day you sneak down to the basement
and stick the coins inside your grandfather's steam-powered replicating invention. A few hours later out shoots
another 10 gleaming coins. How many coins would you have in your treasure chest if you did this every day
for a year? 

>>> 10 * 365
3650
>>> 20 + 3650
3670

Now what if a raven spots the shiny gold sitting in your bedroom and every week flies in and manages to steal three coins?
How many coins would you have left at the end of the year? 

>>> 20 + 10 * 365 - 3 * 52
3514

To see how your pile of gold coins will increase each week: (magic_coins represents the total number of magic coins per week: 10 magic coins per day, seven days in a week):

found_coins = 20
magic_coins = 70
stolen_coins = 3
coins = found_coins
for week in range(1, 53):
    coins = coins + magic_coins - stolen_coins
    print('Week %s = %s' % (week, coins))
